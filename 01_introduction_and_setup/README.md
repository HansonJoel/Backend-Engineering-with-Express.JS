# 🚀 Express.js Learning Journey – First App

This repository Documents my **Backend Engineering journey with Express.js**.  
Here, I set up an **Express server**, learned how `package.json` works, installed dependencies, and explored how Node.js projects are structured.

---

## 📌 What I Learned

- Introduction to **Express.js** and its role in backend development.
- How to set up a new Node.js project with **`package.json`**.
- Installing dependencies using **npm** (`express`) and **dev dependencies** (`nodemon`).
- Understanding `node_modules` and how it manages installed packages.
- Creating my **first Express app** and running a local server.
- Using `.mjs` with `"type": "module"` in `package.json` to support ES modules.

## 🛠️ Project Setup

1. **Initialize project**

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install express mongoose
   npm install --save-dev nodemon
   ```

3. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   node index.mjs
   ```

   **Or with nodemon (auto-restart):**
   nodemon index.mjs

📅 Progress Log
✅ Setup Node.js project & package.json
✅ Installed dependencies (express, mongoose, nodemon)
✅ Created an first Express server with ES modules

⭐️ This is just the beginning — more updates to come as I dive deeper into Express.js!
