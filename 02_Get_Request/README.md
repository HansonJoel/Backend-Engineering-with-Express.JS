ðŸš€ Express.js Learning Journey â€“ GET Requests

This repository continues my **Backend Engineering journey with Express.js**.  
In this stage, I learned how to **define routes** and handle **GET requests** to serve responses like JSON objects and arrays.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What I Learned

- How to define routes in **Express.js**.
- Handling **GET requests** with `app.get()`.
- Sending responses using:
  - `res.send()` for text and objects
  - `res.status()` to define HTTP response codes
- Returning **JSON data** such as users and products.
- Using **route parameters** with `req.params`.

## ðŸ“… Progress Log

- âœ… Setup and run basic Express server
- âœ… Created root (`/`) route with a response
- âœ… Built `/api/users` to return a list of users
- âœ… Used **route parameters** with `/api/users/:id`
- âœ… Added `/api/products` endpoint returning a product list
- â¬œ Next: Explore **POST requests** and handling request bodies
