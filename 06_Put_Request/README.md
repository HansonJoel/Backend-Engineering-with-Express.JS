# 🚀 Express.js PUT Request Tutorial

This project is a simple **Express.js server** that demonstrates how to handle **PUT requests** by updating users in an in-memory database (array).

It was built as part of my learning journey to understand how APIs handle updates with request parameters and request bodies.
